  - updated README with modular file inventory (including TOC/ui/teleport/status/units/demo modules)
  - added developer setup, CI quality gate, and optional git hook usage notes
- Bumped TOC version to `0.9.17`.

## 2026-02-12 - Version 0.9.16
- Fixed LuaLS `redundant-parameter` diagnostics after modularization by aligning fallback callback signatures with real call sites in:
  - `isiLive.lua`
  - `isiLive_commands.lua`
  - `isiLive_demo.lua`
  - `isiLive_events.lua`
  - `isiLive_notice.lua`
  - `isiLive_status.lua`
- Corrected status-controller method calls to consistent dot-style invocation where functions are defined without implicit `self`.
- Bumped TOC version to `0.9.16`.

## 2026-02-12 - Version 0.9.15
- Continued modularization and moved additional logic out of `isiLive.lua` into:
  - `isiLive_units.lua`
  - `isiLive_demo.lua`
  - `isiLive_status.lua`
- Added repo-wide Lua quality tooling and config:
  - `.stylua.toml`
  - `.luacheckrc` (strict globals + WoW API allowlist)
  - `.editorconfig`
  - `.styluaignore`
  - `.vscode/tasks.json`
- Hardened CI quality gate:
  - pinned `StyLua` check in workflow
  - integrated `luacheck` and syntax checks
  - fixed `stylua-action` auth handling (`github.token`)
  - excluded `.luarocks` noise from CI lint/syntax scope
  - fixed `luacheck` CLI arg parsing (`--` separator)
- Standardized release/tag naming to `isiLive_*` and aligned workflow/docs.

## 2026-02-12 - Version 0.9.14
- Modularized addon architecture into dedicated files:
  - `isiLive_locale.lua`
  - `isiLive_sync.lua`
  - `isiLive_queue.lua`
  - `isiLive_inspect.lua`
  - `isiLive_roster.lua`
  - `isiLive_events.lua`
  - `isiLive_commands.lua`
- Added addon-presence roster markers:
  - blue `<3` marker for detected `isiLive` users
  - green `[fullsync]` marker when all visible roster members are detected as `isiLive` users
- Updated test/dummy roster so the local player is always used as `player` entry in test modes.
- Added bottom-right version line in the main window (`V.x.y.z`) sourced from TOC metadata.
- Updated load chat message to: `isiLive: Loaded Version x.x.x.x Press STRG+F9 to open`.
- Kept hidden-window behavior strict with minimal transition path: no non-essential processing while hidden; hotkey/binding flow remains active; small-group `GROUP_ROSTER_UPDATE` still allows auto-open.
- Fixed Lua diagnostics `redundant-parameter` warnings in modular fallbacks by aligning fallback function signatures with call sites.

## 2026-02-12 - Version 0.9.13
- Release-only republish to force a unique CurseForge package artifact after `.11` and `.12` pointed to the same commit.

## 2026-02-12 - Version 0.9.12
- Fixed main window drag reliability:
  - window now supports direct left/right mouse drag
  - top drag handle is forced above overlays to prevent mouse event blocking

## 2026-02-12 - Version 0.9.11
- Fixed queue-teleport highlight reliability so invite-detected dungeon targets are applied immediately and remain stable across follow-up LFG status events.
- Prioritized invite/queue dungeon target for M+ teleport highlighting regardless of current player location/instance.
- Added dedicated mapID-to-teleport helper flow and tightened activity selection to prefer teleport-mappable activities.
- Fixed local function declaration order regression (`ResolveSeason3TeleportSpellIDByMapID`) that could cause a nil-call error in teleport cache building.
- Removed dead code in `isiLive.lua` (`GetUnitID`, unused `mplusActiveSpellID`, inactive duplicate dungeon line updater).

## 2026-02-12 - Version 0.9.10
- Reduced Lua diagnostics noise in `isiLive.lua`:
  - removed deprecated spell-known fallbacks
  - added safer dynamic field/global access (`rawget`) for Blizzard runtime-provided fields/frames
  - improved analyzer-friendly typing around teleport icon handling and rating summary reads
- Restored Russian realm entries in `realm_language_data.lua` with proper UTF-8 names and normalized keys.
- Removed corrupted `????` placeholder keys that produced duplicate-index diagnostics.

## 2026-02-12 - Version 0.9.9
- Reworked right-side M+ teleport UI from single button to multi-button grid (one button per mapped dungeon teleport).
- Added active-target highlight for the currently resolved teleport (strong pulse/glow + tinted overlay).

  - active challenge map
  - current instance map/name

- Updated roster language display to include `flag + 2-letter code` (for example `DE`, `FR`).

## 2026-02-12 - Version 0.9.8
- Added inspect-based specialization (`Spec`) detection for party members and integrated it into the group table.
- Added a new `Spec` column before `Name`, with class-color rendering and localization support.
- Updated roster table alignment and labels:
  - `Name` column is left-aligned
  - German header `Flagge` renamed to `Sprache`
- Added non-Mythic dungeon entry warning as a center-screen notice with 30-second duration.
- Improved center notice interaction:
  - left-click drag to move
  - right-click to dismiss immediately
  - persisted position restore across reload/login
- Updated dummy/test roster values and sample specs to match current test expectations.

## 2026-02-11 - Version 0.9.2
- Improved dungeon teleport secure-button compatibility by expanding secure spell attributes for reliable click-cast behavior.
- Fixed hidden-state queue handling so `LFG_LIST_APPLICATION_STATUS_UPDATED` is still captured and dungeon targets do not stick to test/default values.
- Added automated Lua quality checks via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/lua-check.yml`).
- Added README quality-check section with local `luacheck` command.
- Added explicit versioning rules (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) in `RULES.md`.

- Added `/isilive tptest` to force a dummy teleport target (`The Dawnbreaker`) for isolated teleport-button testing.
- Reduced chat noise by suppressing inspect-timeout chat lines (`Timeout beim Inspizieren von ...`).
- Improved hidden-frame behavior:
  - fully stops scan/processing work while the main window is hidden
  - keeps required transition handling so auto-open on small-group join still works
  - keeps auto-hide behavior on Mythic+ key start

## 2026-02-11 - Version 0.9
- Upgraded the center queue teleport control from text button to spell icon button (secure cast button with spell texture).
- Center queue notice now lasts 20 seconds by default.
- Center queue notice frame is now movable and persists position via `IsiLiveDB.centerNoticePosition`.
- Improved test preview dungeon for teleport testing (`/isilive testall`) by switching dummy dungeon to `The Dawnbreaker`.
- Added a new right-side column `M+ Management`.
- Added a second dungeon teleport icon button under `M+ Management`, synchronized with the latest queued invite dungeon/activity.
- Expanded teleport state handling for both teleport buttons:
  - no target dungeon yet
  - locked teleport (not learned)
  - combat lockdown blocked setup
- Fixed teleport icon/button setup for WoW `12.0.1` secure-cast behavior, including reliable icon visibility and click-cast updates.
- Added teleport cooldown detection with live button state updates and remaining time display in `HH:MM`.
- Fixed `OnEvent` nil-call regression by routing manual event refreshes through the frame's registered event script.
- Fixed protected frame visibility calls during combat by deferring blocked show/hide updates until `PLAYER_REGEN_ENABLED`.
- Improved main window dragging behavior to avoid click conflicts with UI controls while keeping the frame movable.

## 2026-02-10 - Version 0.7
- Fixed queue dungeon resolution to avoid wrong dungeon names from mixed numeric event args.
- Dungeon lookup now prefers the actual `searchResult` activity mapping for invite/application updates.
- Prevented cross-application dungeon carry-over unless the group name matches.
- Improved hotkey robustness for `CTRL+F9` / `CTRL+ALT+F9`:
  - watchdog now re-applies bindings safely after combat if a rebind was blocked in combat lockdown
  - binding click buttons now listen on key down/up and execute on key down for more reliable triggering
- Improved queue join chat visibility by adding white separator lines before and after the message block.
- Added right-side dungeon difficulty indicator (`Normal`/`Heroic`/`Mythic`) with live updates on instance/difficulty changes and key-readiness color hint.
- Added a center notice teleport button for queued invites:
  - maps TWW Season 3 dungeons to their teleport spell IDs (based on TeleportMenu data)
  - enables direct click-cast when the dungeon teleport is known
  - shows locked state when teleport is not unlocked yet and handles combat lockdown safely
